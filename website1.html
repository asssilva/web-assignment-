 FOOD WASTE NOT IN GOOD TASTE!
</strong>
<p> <h3>
After decades of steady decline, the number of people who suffer from hunger – 
as measured by the prevalence of 
undernourishment – began to slowly increase again in 2015. Current estimates 
show that nearly 690 million people are hungry, or 8.9 percent of the world population 
– up by 10 million people in one year and by nearly 60 million in five years.

The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue,
 the number of people affected by hunger would surpass 840 million by 2030.
