<p>Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways meeting society's present food and textile needs, without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs. It can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services.<br>
Conservation practices, such as crop diversification, drip or sprinkler irrigation, zero-soil tillage and growing more crops that rely less on nitrogen, are key to adapting to climate change and solving hunger. According to the report, adopting no-till alone could lift almost 9 percent of people out of hunger by 2050.
Hunger threat is most prominent in contries such as South Sudan ,Syria,Nigeria  & The Sahel.

we should improve and invest in farmer education so people can grow matching plants in relevent environments.</p>
